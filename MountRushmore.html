        The geologic forces of heat, pressure, deposition, uplift and erosion have combined with millions of years of time to create the spectacular setting for the carving of Mount Rushmore. The rocks which form and surround the memorial are part of the “crystalline core” of the Black Hills, the oldest rocks in South Dakota and among the oldest in the western United States.

        There are two distinct stories to tell - the origin of the rocks and the creation of the current topography. The rocks are ancient, the topography is relatively recent.
        The metamorphic rocks we now see began as sediments at the bottom of a shallow sea during the Precambrian period - sometime between 1.6 and 2.5 billion years ago.
