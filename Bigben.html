<div class="POP_UP">This iconic clock that's adjoined to 
    the Britain's House of Parliament may be running out of time. According to a new report,
    the 9-foot-long hour hand and 14-foot-long hands
     of Big Ben’s could break off and crash to the ground without immediate repairs. 
     Parliament has proposed a $45.1 million restoration plan that would keep the clock out 
     of commission for about four months—the longest suspension of timekeeping in the Great Bell
      Tower’s history
    . No date has been set for repairs to begin.</div>
