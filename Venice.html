    Venice is sinking. But how fast has been the subject of great debate. The city has experienced increased incidents of flooding throughout the past decade and local officials have tried to protect the historic sites—without deterring the thousands of tourists that keep the city afloat financially. To the disappointment of celebrities like Cate Blanchett and Michael Douglas, the city overturned a large cruise ship ban last year. If you’re planning a trip to Venice soon, check out information on historic sites that may be closed for restoration during your stay at Venice in Peril. One thing is clear, if you want to make a trip to this iconic Italian city, don’t wait too long.
